    "Summary of Sessions\n",
    "Understanding DataFrame Dimensions and Attributes\n",
    "df.shape: Provides the dimensions of a DataFrame, including the number of rows and columns. This is an attribute of the DataFrame and is accessed without parentheses.\n",
    "df.describe(): Provides summary statistics of numeric columns in the DataFrame, such as count, mean, and standard deviation. This is a method of the DataFrame and is accessed with parentheses.\n",
    "Discrepancies Between df.shape and df.describe()\n",
    "Number of Columns Analyzed: df.shape includes all columns in the DataFrame (both numeric and non-numeric), while df.describe() by default analyzes only numeric columns. Non-numeric columns are excluded from df.describe().\n",
    "Values in the count Column: df.shape shows the total number of rows, while df.describe() shows the count of non-null values in each numeric column. Missing values in numeric columns result in a count less than the total number of rows.\n",
    "Attributes vs. Methods\n",
    "Attributes: Properties or characteristics of an object that provide direct information without any computation or action. Example: df.shape gives the DataFrame's dimensions directly.\n",
    "Methods: Functions associated with an object that perform actions or computations and return results. Example: df.describe() calculates and returns summary statistics for numeric columns.\n",
    "Handling Missing Data\n",
    "df.dropna(): Removes rows with missing values. This is useful when you want to retain only complete records and discard incomplete ones.\n",
    "del df['col']: Deletes a column from the DataFrame. This is useful when you want to remove a variable that may not be relevant or is mostly missing.\n",
    "Examples and Code Fixes\n",
    "Fixing Code: Addressed common issues with DataFrame methods and attributes, including syntax errors and proper usage of methods and attributes.\n",
    "Data Exploration: Demonstrated how to use df.groupby() and df.describe() to analyze grouped data and obtain summary statistics.\n",
    "Practical Application\n",
    "Using df.groupby(\"col1\")[\"col2\"].describe(): This method groups the DataFrame by the specified column (col1), then provides descriptive statistics for the grouped data in col2. This is useful for comparing statistics across different groups.\n",
    "Example from Titanic Dataset: Showed how to load and analyze the Titanic dataset, demonstrating how df.shape and df.describe() can be used to understand dataset dimensions and summary statistics.\n",
    "Final Notes\n",
    "Attributes provide direct access to object properties without computation, while methods perform operations and require execution to provide results.\n",
    "Understanding these concepts helps in effectively analyzing and manipulating data using pandas.\n"
